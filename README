xdg-mini-launcher
=================

This is a desktop launcher application targeting embedded systems.  It
is based upon Thomas-M's excellent xlunch program, found here:

https://github.com/Tomas-M/xlunch

This program loosely follows the desktop entry, menu and XDG base
directory specifications found here:

https://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/
https://specifications.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/index.html
https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/index.html

This program presents a full-screen window to the user with a bunch of
icons obtained from .desktop entry files (only of Type=Application &
Directory are supported).  The icons are organized according to a menu
tree hierarchy specified in the XDG menu file.

This program interacts with a window manager. If the program is
already running, pressing the icon subsequent times will activate the
window of the application (switching to the appropriate virtual
desktop, map the window and bring to the topof the stacking order).

This program does not allow for any run-time reconfiguration.  This is
unlike most of the similar application launchers out there and it is
an intentional design decision.  The rationale is that this program is
intened to run on an embedded device such as a in-vehicle infotainment
(IVI) display, where the configuration is static.

XDG Menu Specification Compliance
---------------------------------

My xdg implementation is not standards-compliant.  I only support the
following XML tags:

Menu
Name
Directory
Include
And
Filename
Menuname

That seems to satisfy my needs for creating a simple menu tree
hierarchy.  Here are some guidelines for creating menus that this
program can parse:

* All Menu elements MUST have only one Name child element.
* All Menu elements MUST have only one Directory child element.
* All Menu elements MUST have only one Include child element.
* All Inlcude elements must have only one And child element.
* All And elements may have any combination of Filename and Menuname elements.
* All Menu elements may have more than one Menu child elements.
* Filename and Menuname elements will be displayed in the order in which they appear within their respective And parent element.

XDG Desktop Entry Specification Compliance
------------------------------------------

Like the menu specification, this program only supports a subset of
freedesktop.org's desktop entry specification.  I support only
.desktop and .directory files.

The desktop files only support the following tags:

Name
Icon
Exec
Path
Terminal (parsed, but not implemented yet)

The directory entry files support only the following tags:

Name
Icon

If the Icon tag is not supplied or is an empty string (i.e. ""), then
this program will attempt to create one at initialization.

minimal-gtest-autotools
-----------------------

This project uses Jon Haggblad's minimal-gtest-autotools, a minimal
template for using gtest (Google Test) in an Autotools project
obtained from:

http://github.com/octol/minimal-gtest-autotools

Depends
-------

- C++ compiler
- Autoconf
- Automake
- Libtool

Build
-----

If you've obtained the template from Github (or any git repo) you need to
generate all the necessary build scripts by running

    autoreconf -ivf

With these in place then

    ./configure
    make

Run the tests with

    make check
