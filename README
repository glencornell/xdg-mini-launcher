xdg-mini-launcher
=================

This is a desktop launcher application targeting embedded systems.  It
is based upon Thomas-M's excellent xlunch program, found here:

https://github.com/Tomas-M/xlunch

This program loosely follows the desktop entry, menu and XDG base
directory specifications found here:

https://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/
https://specifications.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/index.html
https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/index.html

This program presents a full-screen window to the user with a bunch of
icons obtained from .desktop entry files (only of Type=Application are
supported).  The icons are organized according to a menu tree
hierarchy specified in the XDG menu file.

This program interacts with a window manager to place each application
on a separate desktop, if the program is already running, pressing the
icon subsequent times will activate the window of the application.

minimal-gtest-autotools

This project uses Jon Haggblad's minimal-gtest-autotools, a minimal
template for using gtest (Google Test) in an Autotools project
obtained from:

http://github.com/octol/minimal-gtest-autotools

Depends
-------

- C++ compiler
- Autoconf
- Automake
- Libtool

Build
-----

If you've obtained the template from Github (or any git repo) you need to
generate all the necessary build scripts by running

    autoreconf -ivf

With these in place then

    ./configure
    make

Run the tests with

    make check
